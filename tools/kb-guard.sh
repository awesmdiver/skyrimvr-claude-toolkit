# Keep a copy of the files nothing else can rebuild -- and say so when one shrinks.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The documented update path for this toolkit is "extract the new zip
# over your install", so every file the toolkit ships is REPLACED on update. Two of
# them are files you are told to edit: KNOWLEDGEBASE.md (the standing instruction in
# CLAUDE.md appends findings to it after every session) and CLAUDE.md itself (which
# carries your install's own paths). v3.9 moved future accumulation to
# KNOWLEDGEBASE.local.md, which is untracked and gated out of the release payload --
# but that protects only what has not been written yet. An install whose notes are
# ALREADY in the shipped file is covered by exactly one thing: a copy taken BEFORE the
# extract. This takes that copy, once per session, from SessionStart.
#
# ⚠ MEASURED on the author's install 2026-09-08: the backup store held ZERO copies of a
# 177,459-byte KNOWLEDGEBASE.md across seven months. Not because backup-before-edit.sh is
# broken -- it works, and it has no .md or size filter. The cause is the write CHANNEL:
# the knowledgebase is edited through Python invoked via Bash, which an Edit/Write hook
# structurally cannot see. A file can be edited hundreds of times, backed up never, and
# nothing anywhere reports it. That is the gap this closes.
#
# ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. The alarm fires on shrinkage; an update that replaces your
# 100 KB knowledgebase with a 140 KB shipped one is a total loss that shrinks nothing
# and will NOT alarm. The SNAPSHOT is the protection here; the alarm is a convenience
# on top of it. Recovery is always "the previous copy is in the store".
#
# Usage:  bash tools/kb-guard.sh [--verbose]
# Exit:   0 = checked · 1 = ALARM (a watched file shrank or vanished) · 2 = cannot check
