# Downloads the published zip and exercises it. Not the working tree, and not the
# repo -- the ARTIFACT, because those have diverged and shipped a defect here twice:
# once when a release port ran while a mutating gate had a file rewritten in place,
# and once when the safety hooks were fixed in a private install and only the
# references were published.
#
# This lived in a scratchpad for one release and immediately went stale in two
# places -- a checker that matched its own documentation, and an assertion string
# left behind by a wording change. It is a repo tool now for that reason.
#
# Verifies the PUBLISHED ZIP, not the working tree. The two have diverged before:
# a release port ran while a mutating gate had a file rewritten in place, and the
# tracked diff looked right while the bundle carried the mutation. Everything here
# runs against what a user actually extracts.
# ⚠ It checks the PUBLISHED ARTIFACT against THIS CHECKOUT'S expectations -- the hook
# floor and the gate list are read from the working tree, not from the zip (.github is
# excluded from the payload, so the artifact cannot state its own contract). Run it from
# the tag you are verifying. Pointed at an older release from a newer checkout, gates
# added since that release will correctly, and uninterestingly, go red.
