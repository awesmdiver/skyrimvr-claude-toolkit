# Are the safety hooks actually alive -- firing AND receiving their payload?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every hook in this toolkit once read stdin with
# `cat /dev/stdin` and was INERT: it fired on every tool call, read nothing, fell
# through its first guard clause and exited 0 -- byte-identical to deciding "this is
# fine". Nothing was protected, and nothing looked wrong.
#
# The mechanism, MEASURED here 2026-09-06. `/dev/stdin` is a symlink to
# `/proc/self/fd/0`, so it resolves when fd 0 is a real file or a pipe created by an
# MSYS shell -- but it fails with "No such file or directory" when fd 0 is a **Win32
# anonymous pipe from a non-MSYS parent**, which is exactly how Claude Code (a Node
# process) spawns a hook. Hence: fine by hand, dead in production.
#
#   stdin source                          /dev/stdin
#   ------------------------------------  -----------------
#   pipe from an MSYS shell               resolves (31 bytes)
#   a real file handle                    resolves (31 bytes)
#   Win32 pipe from Node / subprocess     FAILS  (0 bytes)
#
# `tests/test_hooks.py` does catch this on Windows, because Python's subprocess
# hands bash a Win32 pipe too -- but it CANNOT catch it on Linux, where /dev/stdin
# resolves for any pipe. So the suite is a real detector on one platform and blind on
# the other, and neither tells you about the install in front of you. That is what
# this script is for: each hook records a heartbeat when it parses a payload and a
# `.blind` marker when it runs and sees nothing, both written from inside a REAL
# invocation. This reads them back.
#
# Exit: 0 = every exercised hook is alive · 1 = at least one is BLIND · 2 = cannot check

  # A blind marker is the loud case: the hook RAN and got nothing. That is the
  # original defect, and it must never read as "fine".
  #
  # But it is only CURRENT if no good payload has arrived SINCE. Both markers are
  # written as YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS, so a lexical compare is a chronological one -- no
  # date parsing, no extra forks. MEASURED 2026-09-09: without this, two .blind
  # markers left by an empty-payload test pinned protect-bash and protect-files to
  # BLIND while their good heartbeats were 107 SECONDS NEWER and the hooks were
  # demonstrably receiving 900+ byte payloads. A canary that cannot go back to
  # green is a canary that gets ignored, which is the same end state as no canary.
  # A blind marker is CURRENT unless a good heartbeat proves the hook recovered
  # AFTER it. Three ways that proof can be absent, all MEASURED as false greens
  # before this was tightened:
  #   * the timestamps are EQUAL       -- same second proves no ordering
  #   * the good one is OLDER          -- a clock stepped back must not read as recovery
  #   * the marker will not parse      -- a truncated `20260909_15` sorts BELOW a real
  #                                       stamp, so a lexical compare silently cleared it
  # Only a well-formed marker with a STRICTLY newer good heartbeat clears. This
  # matters most for backup-before-edit and snapshot-before-tool, which exit 0
  # silently on an empty payload: for those two this report is the only detector.
