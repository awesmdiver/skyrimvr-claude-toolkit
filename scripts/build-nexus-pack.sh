# Build the Nexus upload pack into its ONE canonical home.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Across eleven releases the pack landed in six different shapes:
# v3.2-3.4 wrote `nexus-vX-description.txt`, v3.5.1 switched to `UPLOAD-NOTES.txt`
# plus `mod-page-full-rewrite.txt`, v3.5.4 added a `PATCH-ONLY` file, v3.7 renamed
# the changelog to `CHANGELOG-for-nexus.txt`, **v3.5 and v3.5.3 shipped EMPTY
# directories**, and **v3.9 split in two: a complete pack (zip, changelog,
# description) landed on the //HUB/Downloads-Temp/Downloads share while the
# canonical home got only UPLOAD-NOTES.txt**.
# `nexus-v3.8/` contains a zip named 3.8.1. Prose could not hold the shape; this
# script is the shape.
#
# THE ZIP IS DOWNLOADED, NEVER REBUILT. The bundle users install is built by
# .github/workflows/release.yml from the TAG, with excludes and payload guards
# (tests/ must not leak, KNOWLEDGEBASE.local.md must not ship). Rebuilding it here
# would produce a second artifact that can silently differ from the one GitHub
# serves. We fetch the published asset, so the file the user uploads to Nexus is
# byte-identical to the file the release page hands out.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/build-nexus-pack.sh v3.9 <changelog.txt> <description.txt>
# Exit:   0 pack complete and self-verified · 1 refused or incomplete

# test suite can point this somewhere disposable -- it is NOT a way to improvise a

# eleven releases. It does not pretend to own the prose. Pass the authored file;
# with no argument it drops the raw block as a .DRAFT to edit, and REFUSES to call
# the pack complete.
