"""The knowledgebase guard: does it actually keep the copy it promises?

`tools/kb-guard.sh` exists because the documented update path is "extract the new
zip over your install", which REPLACES every file the toolkit ships -- including
two the user is told to edit. v3.9 moved future accumulation out of the shipped
file; this covers the install that already has notes in it, by taking a copy at
SessionStart before anything can overwrite it.

Every test here asserts on the STORE -- what is on disk afterwards -- not on the
text the tool printed. The report is cosmetic; the copy is the contract. The one
exception is the alarm, where the text IS the deliverable, and there the assertion
is that it names a real, readable file the user can diff against.
