"""The gate that makes every other test in this suite mean something.

A regression test written *after* its bug was fixed passes on the first run,
which proves nothing at all -- it may be asserting the wrong thing, or nothing.
The only proof is to put the bug back and watch the test fail.

So each mutation below reverts one shipped fix on a throwaway copy of the repo,
runs the test that is supposed to guard it, and asserts that test **fails**. If
someone later rewrites a guard into something that no longer bites, this goes
red. Modelled on the X4 toolkit's `mutation_probe` gate.

The working tree is never touched: every mutation is applied to a fresh copy
under pytest's tmp_path, and pytest is re-invoked inside that copy.
