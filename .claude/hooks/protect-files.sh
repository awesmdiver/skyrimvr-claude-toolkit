# Guard Edit/Write against damaging a live Skyrim install.
#
# SETUP: run setup.sh, which fills in the JQ path below. By hand: install jq
# (winget install jqlang.jq), run `where jq`, and paste the path into JQ.
#
# POLICY. A hook exists to stop the ASSISTANT, not to interrupt you. Every rule is
# therefore one of:
#   deny   - refuse the call and say why. Reserved for what is NEVER correct.
#   advise - inject a note into the assistant's context; the call proceeds and you
#            are never prompted.
# `ask` is reserved for what is GENUINELY your decision, and is unused in this file.
# A guard that prompts on routine work gets approved by reflex and then protects
# nothing -- the X4 toolkit measured 40 such prompts across 13,282 commands, every
# one of them noise.
#
# Deny is deliberately a SHORT list. "The mod manager owns it" or "this is risky" is
# a reason to advise, not to refuse: there are legitimate uses for nearly everything
# here, and a guard that blocks legitimate work is a guard that gets deleted.

# MEASURED (X4 toolkit 2026-08-29, reproduced on a second machine 2026-09-06):
# `cat /dev/stdin` returns ZERO BYTES in the Claude Code hook environment, while a
# bare `cat` returns the payload. Seven consecutive probes: 0 bytes via /dev/stdin,
# 641-2840 bytes via bare cat, PreToolUse and PostToolUse alike.
#
# A hook that reads nothing falls through its first guard and exits 0, which is
# BYTE-IDENTICAL to deciding "this is fine". Every hook here was inert that way for
# months while the audit log recorded an empty command field in 2,454 of 2,454
# entries.
#
# WHY NO TEST CAUGHT IT, precisely. /dev/stdin is a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0:
# it resolves when fd 0 is a real file or an MSYS-shell pipe, and FAILS when fd 0
# is a Win32 pipe from a non-MSYS parent -- which is how Claude Code (Node) spawns
# a hook. Python's subprocess does the same, so tests/test_hooks.py DOES detect
# this on Windows and does NOT on Linux. The real reason it survived is simpler:
# nothing ran the hooks as processes at all.
