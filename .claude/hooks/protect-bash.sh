# SETUP: run setup.sh, which fills in the JQ path below. By hand: install jq
# (winget install jqlang.jq), run `where jq`, and paste the path into JQ.

# advise for what is consequential but legitimate, ask only for what is genuinely
# the user's decision (exactly one rule here uses it).

# MEASURED (X4 toolkit 2026-08-29, reproduced on a second machine 2026-09-06):
# `cat /dev/stdin` returns ZERO BYTES in the Claude Code hook environment, while a
# bare `cat` returns the payload. A hook that reads nothing falls through its first
# guard and exits 0 -- byte-identical to deciding "this is fine".
#
# WHY NO TEST CAUGHT IT, precisely. /dev/stdin is a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0:
# it resolves when fd 0 is a real file or an MSYS-shell pipe, and FAILS when fd 0
# is a Win32 pipe from a non-MSYS parent -- which is how Claude Code (Node) spawns
# a hook. Python's subprocess does the same, so tests/test_hooks.py DOES detect
# this on Windows and does NOT on Linux. The real reason it survived is simpler:
# nothing ran the hooks as processes at all.

# --- WHERE IS THE INSTALL, ACTUALLY? ----------------------------------------
#
# The old rule asked "does this command mention a path containing the word Skyrim".
# MEASURED 2026-09-08, every one of these matched and none is the live install:
#
#   C:/Users/Moona/Projects/skyrimvr-claude-toolkit   our own repo checkout
#   .../Temp/claude/C--GOG-Games-...-Skyrim-VR/...    the session scratchpad
#   C:/Temp/skyrim-notes.txt                          a note that happens to be named
#   .../Downloads/skyrimvr-claude-toolkit-3.8.3.zip   a downloaded zip
#
# So a scratchpad cleanup was refused as "deleting the Skyrim install" -- not because
# a game path appeared elsewhere in the command, but because the scratchpad IS a game
# path to that regex. Note what this means: a shell PARSER would not have fixed it. It
# would bind the verb to its target correctly and still deny, because the target still
# matches. The defect was path RECOGNITION, not scoping.
#
# Derived from THIS FILE's location, deliberately NOT from $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR: the
# hooks live at <install>/.claude/hooks/, so ../.. is the install root whichever folder
# the session is rooted in. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR would narrow the guard to a subfolder if
# someone opened Claude Code inside Data/Scripts, and a guard that silently protects
# less than it claims is the defect this replaces.

# at "C:/Games/Skyrim (VR)" must match literally, not as a regex group.

# === HARD BLOCK ===

# which had to contain an `f`. MEASURED -- every one of these reached the game
# directory unrefused while the README promised they could not:
#
#   rm -f -r <game>              two flag tokens
#   rm -r -f <game>              same
#   rm --recursive --force <game>  long flags
#   rm -rf -- <game>             the end-of-options marker
#   cd <game> && rm -rf .        the path is in the cd, not the rm
#   G=<game>; rm -rf "$G"        the path is in a variable
#   rmdir /s /q <game>           not rm at all
#   del /f /s /q <game>          nor this

# So the test is now a CONJUNCTION of two independent things: does the command name
# a destroyer at all, and does it name a qualified path inside a Skyrim install.
# Neither half alone denies.
#
# The cost is honest and deliberate: a compound command that deletes something in
# /tmp while merely MENTIONING a game path is refused too. That is one rephrase into
# two commands, against a claim in the README that the game directory cannot be
# deleted -- and a claim like that has to be true or it should not be made. See
# tests/test_hooks.py, which pins both the catches and the accepted false positive.
